h2. The Textile mark

This mark represents Textile, the markup language created by "Dean Allen":http://alistapart.com/author/deanallen in 2003, which he billed as a "humane web text generator" due to its logical syntax and unobtrusive use -- it gets out of the way and lets you focus on writing.

The mark is available as a full-name wordmark and a symbolic icon. The wordmark is not capitalized. Add the mark of your choosing to your applications and websites, or anywhere else you employ the simplicity of Textile.

This mark was "designed by Destry Wion":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=46453 in 2015, with conceptual input from Julian Reisenberger and GugUser.

h3. The icon mark

!https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/673214/textile-mark-spec.png!

The icon mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively called "tee-dot" for convenience) positioned left on a colored field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and its leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes a common pattern of Textile use (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@...).

Padding between the tee-dot and field edges is defined as:

* x = stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size
* 2x = top, left, and bottom padding, measured from the outermost edges of the "t".
* 6x = right padding, measured from right edge of the dot.

h2. Usage guidelines

You may use the mark as your design needs, but the following guidelines are recommended for universal recognition: 

# Any size, but ensure the padding proportions are safeguarded
# The "t" and dot (tee-dot) should be the same color
# These color options are preferred:
** Any grayscale combo of field and tee-dot
** A white tee-dot on a black field
** A tee-dot in #303030 on a #ffeab6 field, or the inverse
# Give the mark some breathing room fom surrounding elements; 3x is a recommended minimum

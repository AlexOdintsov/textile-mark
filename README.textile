h2. Spec

!https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/673214/textile-mark-spec.png!

The mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively, "tee-dot") positioned left on a background field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and its leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes how several elements of text are notated with Textile (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@, and so forth).

The typeface is PT Sans, and the weight is bold.

Padding between the tee-dot and field edges is defined as:

* x = stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size
* 2x = top, left, and bottom padding
* 6x = right padding

h2. Usage

You may use the mark as your design needs, but the following guidelines are recommended for universal recognition: 

# Any size, but ensure the padding proportions are safeguarded
# The "t" and dot (tee-dot) must be the same color
# These color options only:
** Any grayscale combo of field and tee-dot
** A white tee-dot on a black field
** A tee-dot in #303030 on a #ffeab6 field, or the inverse
# Give the mark some breathing room fom surrounding elements; 3x is a recommended minimum

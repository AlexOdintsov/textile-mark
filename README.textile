h2. The Textile marks

These marks represent Textile, the markup language created by "Dean Allen":http://alistapart.com/author/deanallen in 2003, which he billed as a "humane web text generator" due to its logical syntax and unobtrusive use -- it gets out of the way and lets you focus on writing.

The marks are available as a full-name wordmark and a symbolic icon mark. Add the mark of your choosing to your applications and websites, or anywhere else you employ the simplicity of Textile.

h3. History

The marks were "designed by Destry Wion":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=46453, with conceptual input from Julian Reisenberger and "GugUser":https://github.com/GugUser/.

h2. Specs

The typeface for both wordmark and icon mark is PT Sans, in bold weight. Mark dimensions are based on a relative value of "x", which is the stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size.

h3. The wordmark

The wordmark is not capitalized and can be used with or without a field color, in which case the spacing dimensions are considered either padding or margin, accordingly.

(specs forthcoming after image clean up)

h3. The icon mark

The icon mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively called "tee-dot" for convenience) positioned left on a colored field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and its leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes a common pattern of Textile use (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@...).

Padding between the tee-dot and field edges is defined as:

* 3x/2 = top, left, and bottom padding, measured from the outermost edges of the "t".
* 9x/2 = right padding, measured from right edge of the dot.

h2. Usage guidelines

Use the marks according to needs, but follow the respective guidelines whenever possible for sake of universal recognition.

For both marks:

* Don't change the typeface or font weight.
* Use a flat design (no gloss, shadows, bevels, etc.).
* Use any size, but ensure the relative distances and proportions are safeguarded.
* Use the standard color options:
** grayscale
** white on black
** #303030 on a #ffeab6 (positive) or the inverse (negative)
* Give the mark some breathing room from surrounding UI elements; 3x is a recommended minimum.

For the wordmark:

* Don't capitalize the first letter.
* All letters must be the same color.

For icon mark 

* The "t" and dot (tee-dot) should be the same color.
* Don't make the icon square loosing the padding proportions.

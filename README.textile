h1. The Textile logo marks

These marks represent Textile, the markup language developed by "Dean Allen":http://alistapart.com/author/deanallen in "2002":https://web.archive.org/web/20021226035527/http://textism.com/tools/textile/. Dean never created a mark for Textile, and for nearly 13 years no satisfactory mark existed for writers, designers, and developers to use, until now.

Two marks are available in various formats (see specs below): 

* **wordmark**
* **logo/icon mark** (demoed above)

Use either mark for your applications, websites, or anywhere else you employ the simplicity and pleasure of Textile.

h2. Specs

The typeface for both marks is PT Sans in bold weight. Dimensions are based on a relative value of "x", the stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size.

h3. The wordmark

The wordmark is not capitalized and can be used with or without a field color. If with the field color, the spacing dimensions serve as padding between lettering and field edges:

Padding dimensions are relative to the stem width of a "t", as follows:

* 1.5x = top, left, and bottom; measured from the top of the "l", the left edge of the "t" crossbar, and the bottom edge of "t" curve.
* 2x = right, measured from right edge of the "e" curve.

If without the field color, the dimensions serve as _minimum margins_ from neighboring UI elements and edges:

h3. The logo mark

The logo mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively "tee-dot" for convenience) positioned left on a colored field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and its leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes a common pattern of Textile use (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@...).

Again, padding dimensions are relative to the width of the "t" stem, as follows:

* 1.5x = top, left, and bottom, measured from the outermost edges of the "t".
* 4.5x = right, measured from right edge of the dot.

h2. Usage guidelines

Use the marks however you need, but respect the guidelines when possible for the sake of mark recognition.

For both marks:

* Don't change the typeface or font weight.
* Use a flat design (no gloss, shadows, bevels, etc.).
* Use any size, but ensure the relative distances and proportions are safeguarded.
* Use the recommended colors:
** grayscale (any variation)
** black on field of #ffeab6
** black knockout
** white knockout
* Give the mark some breathing room from surrounding UI elements; 3x is a recommended minimum.

For the wordmark:

* Don't capitalize the first letter.
* All letters must be the same color.

For the logo mark: 

* The "t" and dot (tee-dot) must be the same color.
* Don't make the icon square loosing the padding proportions.

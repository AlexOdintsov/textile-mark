h2. Spec

!https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/673214/textile-mark-spec.png!

Typeface: PT Sans
Weight: Bold
Colors: Any grayscale, including black and white, or the colors #ffeab6 and #303030 inverted either way.

Padding between the letter mark and the field edge is uniform at top, left, and bottom, and greater at right, as follows:

* x = the stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size
* 2x = the top, left, and bottom padding between letter mark and field color edge
* 6x = the right padding

h2. Usage

The mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively, "tee-dot") positioned left on a background field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and it's leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes how several elements of text are notated with Textile (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@, and so forth). 

The mark must be employed as follows: 

# any size, but ensure the padding proportions are safeguarded
# the letter "t" and dot (tee-dot) must be the same color
# these color options only:
** any grayscale combo of field and tee-dot
** a white tee-dot on a black field
** a tee-dot in #303030 on a #ffeab6 field, or the inverse

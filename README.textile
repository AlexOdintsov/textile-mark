h1. The Textile logo marks

These marks represent Textile, the markup language created by "Dean Allen":http://alistapart.com/author/deanallen in 2003. Textile was billed as the "humane web text generator" due to its logical syntax and unobtrusiveness; it gets out of your way so you can focus on writing. For nearly 13 years, no satisfactory mark existed for writers, designers, and developers to use, and now one does.

Two marks are available: a full-name wordmark and a symbolic icon mark. Add the mark of your choosing to your applications, websites, or anywhere else you employ the simplicity of Textile.

h2. Creation and contributions

These marks were "designed by Destry Wion":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=46453, with conceptual input from Julian Reisenberger and "GugUser":https://github.com/GugUser/.

File contributions are welcome if submitted as pull requests to this repo. Such contributions may include, .png icon sets, SVG files, file size reductions, or any other form or version that might be useful and in accordance with the specifications below.

h2. Specs

The typeface for both marks is PT Sans in bold weight. Dimensions are based on a relative value of "x", the stem width of the lowercase "t" at any given font size.

h3. The wordmark

The wordmark is not capitalized and can be used with or without a field color, in which case the spacing dimensions are considered either padding or margin, accordingly.

(specs forthcoming after image clean up)

h3. The icon mark

The icon mark is comprised of three elements: a lowercase "t" and a period/dot (collectively called "tee-dot" for convenience) positioned left on a colored field. The "t" represents Textile's name, and its leftward position, combined with the dot, symbolizes a common pattern of Textile use (@p.@, @bq.@, @bc.@...).

Padding between the tee-dot and field edges is defined as:

* 3x/2 = top, left, and bottom, measured from the outermost edges of the "t".
* 9x/2 = right, measured from right edge of the dot.

h2. Usage guidelines

Use the marks however you need, but respect the guidelines as much as possible for the sake of mark recognition.

For both marks:

* Don't change the typeface or font weight.
* Use a flat design (no gloss, shadows, bevels, etc.).
* Use any size, but ensure the relative distances and proportions are safeguarded.
* Use the standard color options:
** grayscale (any variation)
** #303030 on a #ffeab6 (positive) or the inverse (negative)
** white on black
** black on white (only effective if your UI background is any shade darker than #fff)
* Give the mark some breathing room from surrounding UI elements; 3x is a recommended minimum.

For the wordmark:

* Don't capitalize the first letter.
* All letters must be the same color.

For icon mark 

* The "t" and dot (tee-dot) must be the same color.
* Don't make the icon square loosing the padding proportions.
